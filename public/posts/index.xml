      <description>Hello World! Hello and welcome to Jacana Security Research&amp;rsquo;s first blog post! Jacana is a small security consulting company that specializes in exploring the nooks and crannies of hardware and software to discover bugs and vulnerabilities that could affect the safety and performance of your products. In addition to consulting, Jacana releases videos and blog posts detailing various hacks and exploits. We are strong proponents of open-source technologies and prefer to work in the open as much as possible so that others are empowered to recreate, remix, collaborate, and extend the work that we do.</description>
